        Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the
        Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is the
        ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the
        Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume, by a
        small margin, but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt
        objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller
        than the inner planets. Pluto has roughly one-sixth the mass of the
        Moon, and one-third its volume.

      <p>
        Pluto has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit, ranging from 30 to
        49 astronomical units (4.5 to 7.3 billion kilometres; 2.8 to 4.6 billion
        miles) from the Sun. Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto
        at its orbital distance of 39.5 AU (5.91 billion km; 3.67 billion mi).
        Pluto's eccentric orbit periodically brings it closer to the Sun than
        Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance prevents them from colliding.
