        Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar
        System. In English, it is named after the ancient Roman god Mercurius
        (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of the
        gods. Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the
        same surface gravity as Mars. The surface of Mercury is heavily
        cratered, as a result of countless impact events that have accumulated
        over billions of years. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a
        diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi), which is about one-third the diameter of
        the planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi). Similarly to the Earth's Moon,
        Mercury's surface displays an expansive rupes system generated from
        thrust faults and bright ray systems formed by impact event remnants.

        Mercury's sidereal year (88.0 Earth days) and sidereal day (58.65 Earth
        days) are in a 3:2 ratio. This relationship is called spinâ€“orbit
        resonance, and sidereal here means "relative to the stars".
        Consequently, one solar day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts for
        around 176 Earth days: twice the planet's sidereal year. This means that
        one side of Mercury will remain in sunlight for one Mercurian year of 88
        Earth days; while during the next orbit, that side will be in darkness
        all the time until the next sunrise after another 88 Earth days.
